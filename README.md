# Inventory-Optimization-Model

Inventories represent a considerable investment for every organization; thus, it is important that they be managed well. Excess inventories can indicate poor financial and operational management. On the other hand, not having inventory when it is needed can also result in business failure. The two basic inventory decisions that managers face are how much to order or produce for additional inventory, and when to order or produce it to minimize total inventory cost, which consists of the cost of holding inventory and the cost of ordering it from the supplier.


Please find the Excel file and the R file for the Optimization model. 
•	Identified uncontrollable inputs, model parameters and decision variables that influence total inventory cost, computed the average inventory held throughout the year and holding costs.
•	Implemented the mathematical model and conducted what-if analysis by using two-way table and studied sensitivity of model parameters.
•	Performed 10,000 simulations and 3 hypothesis tests to estimate expected minimum total cost, order quantity and annual number of orders with 95% confidence interval.
