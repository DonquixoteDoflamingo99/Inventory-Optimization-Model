# Inventory-Optimization-Model

Inventories represent a considerable investment for every organization; thus, it is important that they be managed well. Excess inventories can indicate poor financial and operational management. On the other hand, not having inventory when it is needed can also result in business failure. The two basic inventory decisions that managers face are how much to order or produce for additional inventory, and when to order or produce it to minimize total inventory cost, which consists of the cost of holding inventory and the cost of ordering it from the supplier.


Please find the Excel file and the R file for the Optimization model. 
•	Identified uncontrollable inputs, model parameters and decision variables that influence total inventory cost, computed the average inventory held throughout the year and holding costs.
•	Implemented the mathematical model and conducted what-if analysis by using two-way table and studied sensitivity of model parameters.
•	Performed 10,000 simulations and 3 hypothesis tests to estimate expected minimum total cost, order quantity and annual number of orders with 95% confidence interval.

Part-1 
1. Define the data, uncontrollable inputs, model parameters, and the decision variables that 
influence the total inventory cost. 
2. Develop mathematical functions that compute the annual ordering cost and annual holding cost 
based on average inventory held throughout the year and use them to develop a mathematical 
model for the total inventory cost. 
3. Implement your model on an Excel spreadsheet. Then in an R script file. 
4. Use data tables to find an approximate order quantity that results in the smallest total cost. 
5. Plot the Total Cost versus the Order Quantity 
6. Use the Excel Solver to verify your result of part 4 above; that is, find the order quantity which 
would yield a minimum total cost. 
7. Conduct what-if analyses by using two-way tables in Excel to study the sensitivity of total cost to 
changes in the model parameters.    

Part-2 
Perform a simulation consisting of 1000 occurrences and calculate the minimum total cost for 
each occurrence. Next, use the results of your simulation to: 
(i) Estimate the expected minimum total cost by constructing a 95% confidence interval for 
it and determine the probability distribution that best fits its distribution. Verify the 
validity of your choice. 
(ii) Estimate the expected order quantity by constructing a 95% confidence interval for it 
and determine the probability distribution that best fits its distribution. Verify the 
validity of your choice. 
(iii) Estimate the expected annual number of orders by constructing a 95% confidence 
interval for it and determine the probability distribution that best fits its distribution. 
Verify the validity of your choice.
